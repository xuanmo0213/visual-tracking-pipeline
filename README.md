# visual-tracking-pipeline

The purpose of this repository is twofold. First, to create a common ground of the code, scripts, and data that we are using for testing different algorithms. Second, to keep track of our progress for the tasks that will come ahead.
The code that will be submitted here is not for production, but in order to establish some order, there are three things to consider:
1. Create a folder with the name of your debugging tool as part of this repository
2. Create a separate README.md file with a brief description of what your code does, where it has been tested, the inputs needed to run it, and the expected outputs.
3. MAKE SURE THIS CODE WORKS ON YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE COMMITTING IT.
